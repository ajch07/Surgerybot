Untidy wounds \\n \\x17They are due to:\\n –Crushing.\\n –Tearing.\\n –Avulsion. \\n –Devitalised injury.\\n –Vascular injury.\\n –Multiple irregular wounds.\\n –Burns. \\n \\x17Fracture of the underlying bone may be present. \\n Wound dehiscence, infection, delayed healing are common.\\n \\n \\x17Liberal excision of devitalised tissue and allowing to heal \\nby secondary intention is the management.\\n \\x17Secondary suturing, skin graft or flap may be neede d.\\nFig. 1.1B:  Untidy wound\\nII. Classification based on the type of the wound \\nCle\\nan incised wound: It is a tidy, simple, clean cut  wound with \\nlinear cut edges; usually due to a sharp object like blade, glass \\npiece or knife. It is treated by primary suturing. \\nFig. 1.2:  Clean incised wound. \\nLacerated wound: It has ragged edges with some part of the \\ntissues getting devitalized; viability of the tissues may be impaired; depth of the injury and tissue damage should be carefully assessed. Proper adequate wound excision, thorough warm saline wash and suturing of the wound layer-by-layer is required. \\nFigs 1.3A and B: Lacerated wounds. \\nBruise or contusion: It is due to blow or blunt force to the \\nskin and tissues underneath wherein blood vessels or capil-laries are damaged underneath. There is skin discolouration without breaking of the skin; broken vessels cause seepage of blood underneath; minor soft tissue injury crushes small vessels without breaking the skin accumulating trapped blood underneath. It is more on the skin over the bones; lax area like face, scrotum, eyes; vascular areas; children, old aged, fair skin people. \\nHaematoma: It is a localized collection of blood after \\nblunt trauma or after surgery. Collected fluid blood in few minutes to hours gets clotted; later eventually it gets lique-fied and shows discoloured fluid. It may be subcutaneous/ intramuscular/subfascial/intra-articular. Large haematoma may get infected to form an abscess; so large haematoma needs drainage under general or regional anaesthesia. Small haematoma usually gets absorbed (like scalp haematoma). Often haematoma contains reddish plasmatic fluid which should be aspirated using wide bore needle. Complications are—pressure effects and abscess formation; both needs \\nincision and drainage under anaesthesia. Haematoma causing cosmetic problems may require needle aspiration. Haema-toma can occur spontaneously in coagulation disorders (haemophilia) or in individuals who are on anticoagulant drug therapy.

Abdomen and chest are common sites. Liver, bowel, spleen, major vessels and other visceral organs may be \\nFig. 1.4:  Haematoma of eyelid. \\nFig. 1.5:  Haematoma in the groin being aspirated. Haematoma may \\nget infected or can compress adjacent structures.\\nFig. 1.6:  Subungual haematoma. Often nail may need to be \\nremoved to evacuate the blood clot.\\nAbrasion: It is superficial injury (scratch/graze/pressure/contact) and is due to shearing of the skin where the surface is rubbed off. This tangential force causes loss of epidermis exposing dermal vessels and nerves leading into profuse painful oozing. Abrasion heals by epithelialisation. Any dirt or foreign body on the abrasion should be removed to avoid formation of poor tattoo like scar. \\nPuncture wounds and bites: It is usually a stab wound with a \\npointed object; here depth of the wound is more than the width. Deeper vital structures or organs may be injured, so should be assessed; foreign body or object may be present in the depth of the wound. Wound should be explored under general or regional anaesthesia to assess the depth and severity of the injury and sutured layer by layer after through saline wash. \\nSRB's Manual of Surgery\\n 4 Wounds and Wound Healing\\n 5\\ninvolved. Ultrasound and CT scan should be done to evaluate \\ndeeper organ injuries. Under general anaesthesia wound should be explored properly. \\nTraction and avulsion injuries: \\nThese are complex injuries \\nwith tissues getting displaced from its normal anatomical \\nposition and alignment. It can \\noccur in single plane like in \\nsubcutaneous tissue or in multiple planes like in machinery injuries, major injuries or degloving injuries. Ischaemia, bleeding, sepsis, loss of wide tissue area are common prob-lems. Open traction injury occurs on the surface. Closed traction injury can occur in deeper plane like brachial plexus injury or traction bowel injury. After initial resuscitation, definitive treatment like skin graft or nerve repair should be done. \\nCrush injury: It is due to major wounds, war wounds, \\nnatural disaster like earth quake injuries, tourniquet injury. It leads into—compartment syndrome; muscle ischaemia; loss \\nof tissues; gangrene; sepsis. Muscle will lose its viability which is identified by its colour (dark coloured with loss \\nof shining); loss of contractility; turgid, and will not bleed on cutting. \\nFig. 1.10:  Severe crush injury leg. \\nGunshot injuries: These injuries may be superficial or deep. Usually entry wound and exit wound will be present. It causes explosive and destructive injuries along with burn injuries in the deeper planes and organs. It can be high velocity injuries with massive bleeding and major organ injuries. \\nInjuries to bones and joints: It is common in all major injuries; \\nshould be identified clinically and confirmed radiologically. It needs specialized management like reduction, plating etc. \\nInjuries to nerves, arteries, veins (major vessels), deeper \\norgans: It needs initial resuscitation, later staged management as per individual patient basis depending on the severity and extent of injury and loss of function. \\nClosed blunt injury: It may be due to fall, blunt injury wherein \\nno obvious external injury may be seen but deeper injury occurs; it may be often severe enough to cause major injury like in blunt abdominal injury causing bowel/liver/spleen/renal injuries. \\nNote: \\nWound may be closed (bruise, haematoma, blunt injury); open (abrasion, \\nincised, lac\\nerated, penetrating) or complex (traction/avulsion, crush or \\ngunshot injuries). III. C lassification based on thickness of the wound\\n xSuperficial wound involving \\nonly epidermis and dermal papillae. \\n xPartial thickness wound \\nwith skin loss up to deep dermis with \\nonly deepest part of the dermis, hair follicle shafts and sweat \\nglands are left behind. \\n xFull thickness \\nwound with loss of entire skin and subcutaneous \\ntissue causing spacing out of the skin edges. \\n xDeep wounds are the one extending deeper, across deep fascia into\\n \\nmuscles or deeper structures. \\n xComplicat\\ned wounds are one associated with injury to vessels \\nor nerves. \\n xPene\\ntrating wound is one which penetrates into either natural \\ncavities or organs. \\nIV . Classification based on involvement of structures\\n xSimple wounds are one involving only one or\\ngan or tissue. \\n xCombined/complex wounds are one involving mixed tissues. \\nFig. 1.11:  Complex wound exposed tendons.\\nV . Classification based on the time elapsed\\nAcute wounds are generally defined as those that progress through \\nthe normal phases of healing and typically show signs of healing in less than 4 weeks; examples are—surgical or traumatic or burn wounds; progress through the healing phases in a timely and orderly fashion - haemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling or maturation.Chronic wounds are defined as those that do not follow the normal healing process and show no signs of healing in 4 weeks. It fails to progress through the normal phases of healing but with prolonged inflammatory phase. Diabetes, venous/arterial diseases, nutritional deficiencies are the causes. Hypoxia initially is a potent stimulus for fibroblast activity and angiogenesis; persisting hypoxia impedes fibroblast and collagen activity and also allows bacterial invasion to make wounds chronic. Chronic wounds are chronically infected with biofilms which interfere mainly with the inflammatory phase of healing, contributing to the non-healing. A biofilm is a complex structure of microorganisms contained in an extracellular matrix of proteins and polysaccharides that adhere to a surface, creating a protected environment for the organisms. Chronic ulcers are unrespon-sive to dressing treatment; it requires biopsy, culture study, definitive treatment like wound debridement, V AC (Vacuum Assisted Closure) therapy, skin grafting or flap. Specific conditions like tuberculosis if present should be treated. Malignancy if confirmed is treated by wide local excision and skin graft. \\nSRB's Manual of Surgery\\n 4 Wounds and Wound Healing\\n 5\\nFig. 1.12:  Chronic wounds over the scalp\\nvI.

There is more epithelial regeneration than fibrosis. Wound heals rapidly with complete closure. Scar will be linear, smooth, and supple. \\nSecondary \\tHealing\\t(Second\\tIntention)\\n xIt occurs in a wound with extensive soft tissue loss like in major trauma, burns and wound with sepsis. It heals slowly with fibrosis. It leads into a wide scar, often hypertrophied and contracted. It may lead into disability. \\n xRe-epithelialisation occurs from remaining dermal elements or wound margins.\\nFig. 1.18: Wound in the abdomen healing with second intention \\nwhich requires secondary suturing once it granulates well. Secondary suturing is done after 10–14 days, once wound granulates well with proper control of infection. Scar in such type is prone to form incisional hernia.\\nHealing\\tby\\tThird\\tIntention \\t(Ter tiary\\tWound\\tHealing\\tor\\t\\nDelayed\\tPrimar\\ny\\tClosure)\\t\\nAfter wound debridement and control of local infection, wound is closed with sutures or covered using skin graft. Primary contaminated or mixed tissue wounds heal by tertiary intention.\\nFigs 1.16A and B: Acute peritonitis with frank pus in peritoneal \\ncavity due to bowel perforation is a dirty wound .\\nFig. 1.17: Wound causing extensive skin loss and necrosis.\\nWound  HEALI nG \\nA scab is a beautiful thing—a coin the body has minted, with \\nan invisible motto: In God We Trust. Our body loves us, and, even while the spirit drifts dreaming, works at mending the damage that we do. \\n—John Updike, 1984BA\\nSRB's Manual of Surgery\\n 6 Wounds and Wound Healing\\n 7\\nStages of wound healing \\n \\x99Stage of inflammation.\\n \\x99Stage of granulation tissue formation and organi  sa tion. Here due \\nto fibroblastic activity synthesi  sa\\ntion of collagen and ground \\nsubstance occurs. \\n \\x99Stage of epithelialisation. \\n \\x99Stage of scar formation and resorption.\\n \\x99Stage of maturation. \\nPhases of Wound Healing \\nInflammatory \\tphase\\t(Lag\\tor\\tSubstrat e\\tor\\tExudative \\tPhase)\\t\\n xIt begins immediately after formation and lasts for 72 hours. \\n xThere\\n is initial arteriolar vasoconstriction, thrombus formation, \\nplatelet aggregation due to endothelial damage and release of \\nadenosine diphosphate (ADP). \\n xLater vasodilatation and increased vascular permeability develops. \\n xHere haemostasis, coagulation and chemotaxis  occur\\n. \\nNote: \\nCoagulation begins at wound haematoma →  formation of platelet \\nfibrin thrombus → release of cytokines, PDGF (platelet-derived growth \\nfactor), epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor β (TGF – β), platelet activating factor and platelet factor IV, fibrin, sero -\\ntonin. Chemotaxis causes first neutrophil migration, and then activa-tion of macrophages, lymphocytes leading into phagocytosis, wound debridement, matrix activation, angiogenesis. Chemotaxis factors are complement factors, interleukin-1, TNF-α (tumour necrosis factor-α) TGF–β and platelet factor. Activated macrophages produce free radi-cals and nitric oxide; release cytokine to activate lymphocytes which release interferon and interleukin (called as lymphokines). These factors attract polymorpho nuclear leucocytes (PMN—poly morphonuclear cells–neutrophills) in 48 hours secreting inflammatory mediators and bactericidal oxygen derived-free radicals. Injured tissues and platelet release histamine, serotonin and prostaglandins which increases the vascular permeability by vasodilatation. These actions are reduced in diabetes mellitus, Cushing’s syndrome and immunosuppression increasing the sepsis rate. \\n xAll these cause features of acute inflammation — rubor, calor, \\ntumour, dolor and loss of function. \\nProliferative \\tPhase\\t( Collagen/ Fibroblastic \\tphase)\\t\\n xIt begins from 3rd day and lasts for 3–6 weeks. There will be forma-\\ntion of granulation tissue and repair of the wound. Granulation \\ntissue contains fibroblasts, neocapillaries, collagen, fibronectin and hyaluronic acid. \\n x(1) Initial angiogenesis\\n (growth of new blood vessels) occurs \\nby release of vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF) by keratinocytes; by release of TNF-α, TGF–β, PDGF, FGF by macrophages. (2) Eventual fibroplasia develops by fibroblast activity with formation of the collagen and ground substance/glycosaminoglycans. Type III collagen is deposited initially in a random fashion. (3) Later re-epithelialisation of the wound surface occurs by migration of basal layer of the retained epidermis which proliferates, differentiates and stratifies to form wound closure. Remodelling \\tphase\\t(Matur ation\\tP hase)\\t\\n xIt begins at 6 weeks and lasts for 6 months to 1 or 2 years. \\n xThe\\nre is maturation of collagen by cross linking and realignment \\nof collagen fibers along the line of tension, which is responsible for tensile strength of the scar. There is reduced wound vascularity. Fibroblast and myofibroblast activity causes wound contraction. Type III collagen is replaced by type I collagen causing maturation of the collagen. Ratio of type I collagen to type III collagen becomes 4:1. \\n xEarly extracellular matrix \\ncontains fibronectin and collagen type \\nIII; eventually it contains glycosaminoglycans and proteoglycans; final matrix contains type I collagen. \\n xScar strength \\nis 3% in 1 week; 20% in 3 weeks; 80% in 12 weeks. \\nFinal matured scar is acellular and avascular. \\nNote:  \\nInitially fibrin, fibronectin, proteoglycans deposition occurs; later \\ncollagen protein develops to form scar. Normal dermal skin contains 80% type I (20% type III) collagen; granulation tissue contains mainly type III collagen; scar contains both type I and III collagen, initially in equal proportion, later becomes 4:1. Basic essential components of collagen are proline and lysine. Hydroxylation of lysine and later glycosylation of this hydroxylysine decides the type of collagen molecule. Hydroxylation of both proline and lysine as essential step needs adequate concentration of vitamin C, iron and α ketogluteric acid. Collagen deposition in the wound is assessed by quantity of hydroxyproline excreted in urine. There is a balanced activity of collagen production and degradation of collagen (collagenolysis). Collagen is broken down by collagenase and MMPs (matrix metallo- proteinases). Procollagen through procollagenase →  collagen fibril → \\ncross linking →  collagen fiber →  deposition. Deposited collagen → \\nthrough collagenase →  degradation and collagenolysis. \\nClinical diagnosis is an art, and the mastery of an art has no end: you can always be a better diagnostician\\n—Logan ClendeningPoints to be remembered \\n \\x99PMN cells survive only for 24 hours; so after 48 hours PMNs won’t \\nbe found in the wound significantly; PMNs are not needed for wound healing. \\n \\x99Activated monocytes called macrophages predominate after 48 hours which will persist until completion of the wound healing. Macrophages are the main cells of wound healing. Macrophages secrete TNF - α , interleukin -1, fibroblast growth factor (FGF), \\nproteinases (MMPs – matrix metallo proteinases). \\n \\x99B lymphocyte will not have any role in wound healing; T lymphocytes produce stimulatory cytokines like interleukin – 1 supporting the fibroblast activity. \\n \\x99Collagen and glycosamines are produced by fibroblasts. Tropoco -\\nllagen is produced which aggregates to form collagen fibrils. \\n \\x99Hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine are synthesized by specific enzymes using iron, α ketoglutarate and vitamin C. \\n \\x99Fibroblast requires vitamin C to produce collagen. \\n \\x99Granulation tissue and early scar contains type III collagen. \\n \\x99Final scar contains type I collagen mainly. \\n \\x99Final extra cellular matrix contains type I collagen and proteo -\\nglycans. \\n \\x99Collagen production decreases after 4 weeks of wound healing (declines in 28-42 days). \\n \\x99Eighty per cent of tensile strength of normal skin will be achieved finally but not 100%\\nSRB's Manual of Surgery\\n 8 Wounds and Wound Healing\\n 9\\nWound infection:  Infection prolongs inflammatory phase, releases \\ntoxins and utilizes vital nutrients thereby prevents wound epithelialisa-\\ntion. The β-haemolytic streptococci more than 105 per gram of tissue \\nprevent wounds healing. Formation of biofilms on the wound surface by microorganisms prevents wound healing. \\nAnaemia: Haemoglobin less than 8g % causes poor oxygenation of \\ntissues preventing healing of the wounds. \\nHypoxia: Hypoxia prevents fibroblast proliferation and collagen \\nsynthesis; it also promotes bacterial invasion into the wound. Causes of hypoxia are—arterial diseases, cardiac failure, respiratory causes, hypotension, smoking, tobacco, infection, diabetes mellitus and radiation. \\nRadiotherapy: Both external radiotherapy or ionizing radiation cause \\nendarteritis, fibrosis and delay in wound healing. Radiation may itself cause local tissue necrosis, sepsis and hypoxia. \\nSystemic and metabolic causes: Diabetes mellitus affects all stages \\nof wound healing. Cardiac, renal, hepatic, respiratory diseases prevent wound healing. Tissue oedema impairs wound healing. HIV and immunosuppression of varying causes, malignancy leads into poor wound healing. Jaundice interferes with wound healing. Obesity causes hypoperfusion, reduced microcirculation, increased wound tension and hence prevents wound healing. \\nDrugs:  Steroids interfere with activation of macrophages, fibro-\\nblasts and angiogenesis in the early phase of healing (proliferative). \\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) decrease collagen production. Chemotherapeutic agents used in oncology inhibit cellular proliferation, protein synthesis. Alcohol consumption decreases the phagocyte response and pro-inflammatory cytokine release; diminishes \\nhost response and thus increasing the infection rate.\\nLocal factors\\n \\x99Infection\\n \\x99Presence of necrotic tissue and foreign body\\n \\x99Poor blood supply\\n \\x99Venous or lymph stasis\\n \\x99Tissue tension\\n \\x99Haematoma\\n \\x99Large defect or poor apposition\\n \\x99Recurrent trauma\\n \\x99X-ray irradiated area\\n \\x99Site of wound, e.g. wound over the joints and back has poor\\nhealing\\n \\x99Underlying diseases like osteomyelitis and malig  nancy\\n \\x99Mechanism and type of wound—incised/lacerated/crush/avulsion\\n \\x99Tissue hypoxia locally reduces macrophage and fibroblast activity\\nGeneral Factors \\n \\x99Age, o besity, smoking, alcohol, stress\\n \\x99Malnutrition, zinc, copper, manganese\\n \\x99Vitamin deficiency (Vit C, Vit A)\\n \\x99Anaemia, hypoxia\\n \\x99Malignancy\\n \\x99Uraemia\\n \\x99Jaundice \\n \\x99Diabetes, metabolic diseases\\n \\x99HIV and immunosuppressive diseases\\n \\x99Steroids and cytotoxic drugs\\n \\x99Neuropathies of different causesFactors\\taffecting\\tWound\\tHealing\\nAge: In younger age group wound healing is faster and better. In \\nelderly healing is delayed due to reduction in collagen synthesis, epithelialisation, growth factors and angiogenesis. But final scar will be excellent in old individuals. \\nNutrition: Adequate vitamin, trace elements, fatty acids and proteins \\nare essential for wound healing. Vitamin A deficiency affects mono-\\ncyte activation, inflammatory phase, collagen synthesis and growth factor actions. Vitamin K deficiency affects synthesis of prothrombin (II), factors VII, IX and X. Vitamin E, being an antioxidant stabilizes the cell membrane. Vitamin C deficiency impairs collagen synthesis, \\nfibroblast proliferation and angiogenesis; increases the capillary fragility and susceptibility for infection. Zinc is an essential cofactor for RNA and DNA polymerase; magnesium is a co-factor for synthesis \\nof proteins and collagen; copper is a required co-factor for cytochrome oxidase, for cytosolic anti-oxidant superoxide dismutase, and for the optimal cross-linking of collagen; Iron is required for the hydroxyla-\\ntion of proline and lysine. Glutamine is the most abundant amino acid in plasma; is a major source of energy for rapidly proliferating cells such as fibroblasts, lymphocytes, epithelial cells, and macrophages. The serum concentration of glutamine is reduced after major surgery, trauma, and sepsis, and supplementation of this amino acid improves nitrogen balance and diminishes immunosuppression. Glutamine stimulates the inflammatory immune response in early wound healing. Oral glutamine supplementation improves wound breaking strength and of mature collagen. Arginine  is a semi-essential amino acid that \\nis required in growth, severe stress, and injury. Arginine modulates immune function, wound healing, hormone secretion, vascular tone, and endothelial function. Arginine is a precursor to proline; supports collagen deposition, angiogenesis, and wound contraction. Under psychological stress situations, the metabolic demand of arginine increases, and its supplementation hastens the wound healing. Serum \\nalbumin level less than 2 g/dl causes prolonged inflammatory phase, decreased fibroplasia, neovascularisation and cell synthesis and wound remodeling and hence decreased wound healing. Wounds in patients who remain in catabolic state will not heal. Collagen is the \\nmajor protein component of connective tissue; it contains mainly glycine, proline, and hydroxyproline. Collagen synthesis requires hydroxylation of lysine and proline, and co-factors such as ferrous iron and vitamin C. Polyunsaturated fatty acids which cannot be synthesized de novo by mammals, consist mainly of omega-6 (found \\nin soybean oil) and omega-3 (found in fish oil—fatty acids such as eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] and docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]). They affect pro-inflammatory cytokine production, cell metabolism, gene expression and angiogenesis; improve the systemic immune function of the host, thus reducing infectious complications. \\nFig. 1.19: Healing ulcer with healthy granulation tissue which is \\nready for skin grafting.\\nSRB's Manual of Surgery\\n 8 Wounds and Wound Healing\\n 9\\nManagement of Wounds \\nWound\\tcleaning\\t\\nWound cleaning is needed to optimize the healing environ -\\nment. It is achieved by removing visible devitalized tissues or \\ndressing materials or excess exudates or crusts. \\nAbsolute aseptic technique should be used while cleaning \\nthe wound; warm sterile isotonic normal saline (37°C—this is optimum temperature to support cellular activity) is ideal; normal exudates in the wound should be removed; gentle cleaning of the wound is important to minimize the interfer -\\nence of the wound-healing process. Cleaning agent should be of neutral pH and nontoxic; delipidising agents, antiseptics, alkaline soaps should be avoided. Gentle irrigation of warm saline using a sterile syringe on the wound surface is ideal; rubbing with undue force using cotton or gauze may cause mechanical damage on the process of wound healing. \\nWound is measured either in two dimensions (length and \\nwidth) or in three dimensions (length, width and depth). \\nSpecific\\tManagement\\n xWound is inspected and classified as per the type of wounds.\\n xIf it is in the vital area, then:\\n \\x17The airway should be maintained.\\n \\x17The bleeding, if present, should be controlled. \\n \\x17Intravenous fluids are started. \\n \\x17Oxygen, if required, may be given. \\n \\x17Deeper communicating injuries and fractures, etc. \\nshould be looked for.\\n xIf it is an incised wound then primary suturing is done after \\nthorough cleaning. \\n xIf it is a lacerated wound then the wound is excised and \\nprimary suturing is done.\\n xIf it is a crushed or devitalised wound there will be oedema and tension in the wound. So after wound debridement or wound excision by excising all devitalised tissue, the oedema is allowed to subside for 2–6 days. Then delayed \\nprimary suturing is done. \\n xIf it is a deep devitalised wound, after wound debridement \\nit is allowed to granulate completely. Later, if the wound is small secondary suturing is done. If the wound is large a \\nsplit skin graft (Thiersch graft) is used to cover the defect.\\n xIn a wound with tension, fasciotomy is done so as to prevent the development of compartment syndrome. \\n xVascular or nerve injuries are dealt with accordingly. Vessels are sutured with 6-zero polypropylene nonabsorb-able suture material. If the nerves are having clean cut wounds it can be sutured primarily with polypropylene 6-zero or 7-zero suture material. If there is difficulty inidentifying the nerve ends or if there are crushed cut ends of nerves then marker stitches are placed using silk at the site and later secondary repair of the nerve is done. \\n xInternal injuries (intracranial by craniotomy, intrathoracic by \\nintercostal tube drainage, intra-abdominal by laparotomy) has to be dealt with accordingly. Fractured bone is also identified and properly dealt with. \\n xAntibiotics, fluid and electrolyte balance, blood transfusion, tetanus toxoid (0.5 ml intramuscular to deltoid muscle), or antitetanus globulin (ATG) injection.\\nLater definitive management is done with:\\nWound debridement (wound toilet, or wound excision) is liberal \\nexcision of all devitalised tissue at regular intervals (of 48-72 hours) until healthy, bleeding, vascular tidy wound is created.\\nTypes of wound suturing \\n\\t\\x99Primary\\tsuturing means suturing the wound immedia  tely within \\n6 hours\\n.

It often maintains the normal colour and temperature of the fingers and distal pulses may not be oblit -\\nerated in spite of severe muscle ischaemia. Muscle ischaemia more than 4 hours causes muscle death and myoglobinuria. Irreversible nerve damage develops if ischaemia persists for 8 hours. Progressive, persistent severe pain which is aggravated by passive muscle stretching is the diagnostic sign. Tense tender regional lymph node is typical. Pulse will be usually normally felt in compartment syndrome; but may become absent if there is associated arterial injury.

It can be measured by placing a fine catheter in the compart-ment and using a pressure monitor. This is an indication for fasciotomy. Adequate lengthy incision involving skin, fat and deep fascia should be done until underneath muscle bulges out properly. Multiple incisions should be made if needed. Separate incision in each compartment should be done. \\nFasciotomy done in forearm anterior compartment is a specific method. \\nCarpal tunnel should be released by cutting flexor retinaculum. Inci-\\nsion begins at the junction of the thenar and hypothenar area; extends proximally initially transverse across flexion crease of the wrist at the ulnar border; then across forearm towards radial side of forearm; then in proximal forearm towards medial side creating convex flap towards lateral side. In the elbow it crosses along the medial border to reach the arm where it runs in arm along the medial part of the anterior arm. Injury to major nerves, palmar cutaneous branch of median nerve should be avoided while placing the incision. Incision should be deepened by cutting the deep fascia along the entire length of the incision. Dorsal fasciotomy  \\nshould be added by placing longitudinal lengthy incision in the midline. Two longitudinal incisions on the dorsum of the hand also should be made. \\nFig. 1.24:  Incision for fasciotomy in upper limb begins at flexor \\nretinaculum extending into the forearm with a convex flap towards radial \\nside eventually leading towards medial epicondyle of the elbow joint.\\n xAntibiotics. \\n xCatheterisation. \\n xMannitol or diuretics to cause diuresis, so as to flush the kidney\\n. \\n xFresh blood transfusion. \\n xHyperbaric oxygen. \\nCRuSH  I nJuR Y \\nCrush injury is one where a part of the body is being squeezed/\\ncompressed between two high force or pressure systems.

It develops in 1 to 3 months after trauma. It improves spontaneously. \\n \\x99Keloid is persistent excessive growth of the scar beyond itsmargin into the adjacent skin; occurs in a triangular area between two shoulder points and xiphisternum. It develops 3 months to years after the trauma; progressive.

Margin : It may be regular or irregular. It may be rounded or oval.\\nb. Edge:  Edge is the one which connects floor of the ulcer to the\\nmargin. Different edges are:\\nSloping edge. It is seen in a healing ulcer. \\n Its inner part is red because of red, healthy granulation tissue. \\n Its outer part is white due to scar/fibrous tissue. \\n Its middle part is blue due to epithelial prolife  ration. \\nUndermined edge  is seen in a tuberculous ulcer. Disease process \\nadvances in deeper plane (in subcutaneous tissue) whereas (skin) \\nepidermis proliferates inwards. \\nPunched out edge  is seen in a gummatous (syphilitic) ulcer and \\ntrophic ulcer. It is due to endarteritis. \\nRaised and beaded edge (pearly white) is seen in a rodent ulcer \\n(BCC). Beads are due to proliferating active cells. \\nEverted edge (rolled out edge ): It is seen in a carcino  matous ulcer \\ndue to spill of the proliferating malignant tissues over the normal skin.\\nc. \\n Floor:  It is the one which is seen. Floor may contain discharge,\\ngranulation tissue or slough.\\nd.  Base:  Base is the one on which ulcer rests. It may be bone or soft\\ntissue.\\nFig. 1.34:  Parts of an ulcer.\\nFig. 1.35:  Ulcer edges.\\nInduration of an Ulcer \\nInduration is a clinical palpatory sign which means a specific type of hardness in the diseased tissue. It is obvious in well-differentiated carcinomas. It is better felt in squamous cell carcinoma. It is also observed in long standing ulcer with underlying fibrosis. It is absent or less in poorly differentiated carcinomas and malignant melanoma. Less indurated carcinoma is more aggressive. Specific types of indurations are observed in venous diseases and chronic deep venous thrombosis. Brawny induration is a feature of an abscess. Induration is felt at edge, base and surrounding area of an ulcer. Induration at surrounding area signifies the extent of disease (tumour). Outermost part of the indurated area is taken as the point from where clearance of wide excision is planned.\\nClassifications \\nClassification I ( Clinical) \\n1. Spreading ulcer : Here edge is inflamed, irregular and\\noedematous.

Collected fluid blood in few minutes to hours gets clotted; later eventually it gets lique-fied and shows discoloured fluid. It may be subcutaneous/ intramuscular/subfascial/intra-articular. Large haematoma may get infected to form an abscess; so large haematoma needs drainage under general or regional anaesthesia. Small haematoma usually gets absorbed (like scalp haematoma). Often haematoma contains reddish plasmatic fluid which should be aspirated using wide bore needle.

Classification based on the time elapsed\\nAcute wounds are generally defined as those that progress through \\nthe normal phases of healing and typically show signs of healing in less than 4 weeks; examples are—surgical or traumatic or burn wounds; progress through the healing phases in a timely and orderly fashion - haemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling or maturation.Chronic wounds are defined as those that do not follow the normal healing process and show no signs of healing in 4 weeks. It fails to progress through the normal phases of healing but with prolonged inflammatory phase. Diabetes, venous/arterial diseases, nutritional deficiencies are the causes. Hypoxia initially is a potent stimulus for fibroblast activity and angiogenesis; persisting hypoxia impedes fibroblast and collagen activity and also allows bacterial invasion to make wounds chronic. Chronic wounds are chronically infected with biofilms which interfere mainly with the inflammatory phase of healing, contributing to the non-healing. A biofilm is a complex structure of microorganisms contained in an extracellular matrix of proteins and polysaccharides that adhere to a surface, creating a protected environment for the organisms. Chronic ulcers are unrespon-sive to dressing treatment; it requires biopsy, culture study, definitive treatment like wound debridement, V AC (Vacuum Assisted Closure) therapy, skin grafting or flap. Specific conditions like tuberculosis if present should be treated. Malignancy if confirmed is treated by wide local excision and skin graft. \\nSRB's Manual of Surgery\\n 4 Wounds and Wound Healing\\n 5\\nFig. 1.12:  Chronic wounds over the scalp\"), Document(metadata={'source': '../../SRB’s Manual of Surgery.txt', 'page_number': 13}, page_content=\"SRB's Manual of Surgery\\n 4 Wounds and Wound Healing\\n 5\\nFig. 1.12:  Chronic wounds over the scalp\\nvI.

Chemotaxis causes first neutrophil migration, and then activa-tion of macrophages, lymphocytes leading into phagocytosis, wound debridement, matrix activation, angiogenesis. Chemotaxis factors are complement factors, interleukin-1, TNF-α (tumour necrosis factor-α) TGF–β and platelet factor. Activated macrophages produce free radi-cals and nitric oxide; release cytokine to activate lymphocytes which release interferon and interleukin (called as lymphokines). These factors attract polymorpho nuclear leucocytes (PMN—poly morphonuclear cells–neutrophills) in 48 hours secreting inflammatory mediators and bactericidal oxygen derived-free radicals. Injured tissues and platelet release histamine, serotonin and prostaglandins which increases the vascular permeability by vasodilatation.

Normal dermal skin contains 80% type I (20% type III) collagen; granulation tissue contains mainly type III collagen; scar contains both type I and III collagen, initially in equal proportion, later becomes 4:1. Basic essential components of collagen are proline and lysine. Hydroxylation of lysine and later glycosylation of this hydroxylysine decides the type of collagen molecule. Hydroxylation of both proline and lysine as essential step needs adequate concentration of vitamin C, iron and α ketogluteric acid. Collagen deposition in the wound is assessed by quantity of hydroxyproline excreted in urine. There is a balanced activity of collagen production and degradation of collagen (collagenolysis). Collagen is broken down by collagenase and MMPs (matrix metallo- proteinases). Procollagen through procollagenase →  collagen fibril → \\ncross linking →  collagen fiber →  deposition.

Vitamin K deficiency affects synthesis of prothrombin (II), factors VII, IX and X. Vitamin E, being an antioxidant stabilizes the cell membrane.

Glutamine is the most abundant amino acid in plasma; is a major source of energy for rapidly proliferating cells such as fibroblasts, lymphocytes, epithelial cells, and macrophages. The serum concentration of glutamine is reduced after major surgery, trauma, and sepsis, and supplementation of this amino acid improves nitrogen balance and diminishes immunosuppression. Glutamine stimulates the inflammatory immune response in early wound healing. Oral glutamine supplementation improves wound breaking strength and of mature collagen. Arginine  is a semi-essential amino acid that'), Document(metadata={'source': '../../SRB’s Manual of Surgery.txt', 'page_number': 13}, page_content=\"is required in growth, severe stress, and injury. Arginine modulates immune function, wound healing, hormone secretion, vascular tone, and endothelial function. Arginine is a precursor to proline; supports collagen deposition, angiogenesis, and wound contraction. Under psychological stress situations, the metabolic demand of arginine increases, and its supplementation hastens the wound healing. Serum \\nalbumin level less than 2 g/dl causes prolonged inflammatory phase, decreased fibroplasia, neovascularisation and cell synthesis and wound remodeling and hence decreased wound healing. Wounds in patients who remain in catabolic state will not heal. Collagen is the \\nmajor protein component of connective tissue; it contains mainly glycine, proline, and hydroxyproline. Collagen synthesis requires hydroxylation of lysine and proline, and co-factors such as ferrous iron and vitamin C. Polyunsaturated fatty acids which cannot be synthesized de novo by mammals, consist mainly of omega-6 (found \\nin soybean oil) and omega-3 (found in fish oil—fatty acids such as eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] and docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]).

It is seen in a healing ulcer. \\n Its inner part is red because of red, healthy granulation tissue. \\n Its outer part is white due to scar/fibrous tissue. \\n Its middle part is blue due to epithelial prolife  ration. \\nUndermined edge  is seen in a tuberculous ulcer. Disease process \\nadvances in deeper plane (in subcutaneous tissue) whereas (skin) \\nepidermis proliferates inwards. \\nPunched out edge  is seen in a gummatous (syphilitic) ulcer and \\ntrophic ulcer. It is due to endarteritis. \\nRaised and beaded edge (pearly white) is seen in a rodent ulcer \\n(BCC).

It is obvious in well-differentiated carcinomas. It is better felt in squamous cell carcinoma. It is also observed in long standing ulcer with underlying fibrosis. It is absent or less in poorly differentiated carcinomas and malignant melanoma. Less indurated carcinoma is more aggressive. Specific types of indurations are observed in venous diseases and chronic deep venous thrombosis. Brawny induration is a feature of an abscess. Induration is felt at edge, base and surrounding area of an ulcer. Induration at surrounding area signifies the extent of disease (tumour). Outermost part of the indurated area is taken as the point from where clearance of wide excision is planned.\\nClassifications \\nClassification I ( Clinical) \\n1.

Classification based on involvement of structures\\n xSimple wounds are one involving only one or\\ngan or tissue. \\n xCombined/complex wounds are one involving mixed tissues. \\nFig. 1.11:  Complex wound exposed tendons.\\nV . Classification based on the time elapsed\\nAcute wounds are generally defined as those that progress through \\nthe normal phases of healing and typically show signs of healing in less than 4 weeks; examples are—surgical or traumatic or burn wounds; progress through the healing phases in a timely and orderly fashion - haemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling or maturation.Chronic wounds are defined as those that do not follow the normal healing process and show no signs of healing in 4 weeks. It fails to progress through the normal phases of healing but with prolonged inflammatory phase. Diabetes, venous/arterial diseases, nutritional deficiencies are the causes. Hypoxia initially is a potent stimulus for fibroblast activity and angiogenesis; persisting hypoxia impedes fibroblast and collagen activity and also allows bacterial invasion to make wounds chronic. Chronic wounds are chronically infected with biofilms which interfere mainly with the inflammatory phase of healing, contributing to the non-healing. A biofilm is a complex structure of microorganisms contained in an extracellular matrix of proteins and polysaccharides that adhere to a surface, creating a protected environment for the organisms. Chronic ulcers are unrespon-sive to dressing treatment; it requires biopsy, culture study, definitive treatment like wound debridement, V AC (Vacuum Assisted Closure) therapy, skin grafting or flap. Specific conditions like tuberculosis if present should be treated. Malignancy if confirmed is treated by wide local excision and skin graft. \\nSRB's Manual of Surgery\\n 4 Wounds and Wound Healing\\n 5\\nFig. 1.12:  Chronic wounds over the scalp\"), 0.16485427762695337), (Document(id='400c5575-9ad0-4666-ad65-271791642d9d', metadata={'source': '../../SRB’s Manual of Surgery.txt', 'page_number': 13}, page_content=\"SRB's Manual of Surgery\\n 2 Wounds and Wound Healing\\n 3\\nb.

It is more on the skin over the bones; lax area like face, scrotum, eyes; vascular areas; children, old aged, fair skin people. \\nHaematoma: It is a localized collection of blood after\"), 0.1746482281618934), (Document(id='6d6de05b-245f-4d75-aa26-89d8b4bdbe47', metadata={'source': '../../SRB’s Manual of Surgery.txt', 'page_number': 13}, page_content=\"Puncture wounds and bites: It is usually a stab wound with a \\npointed object; here depth of the wound is more than the width. Deeper vital structures or organs may be injured, so should be assessed; foreign body or object may be present in the depth of the wound.

Ischaemia, bleeding, sepsis, loss of wide tissue area are common prob-lems. Open traction injury occurs on the surface. Closed traction injury can occur in deeper plane like brachial plexus injury or traction bowel injury. After initial resuscitation, definitive treatment like skin graft or nerve repair should be done. \\nCrush injury: It is due to major wounds, war wounds, \\nnatural disaster like earth quake injuries, tourniquet injury. It leads into—compartment syndrome; muscle ischaemia; loss \\nof tissues; gangrene; sepsis. Muscle will lose its viability which is identified by its colour (dark coloured with loss \\nof shining); loss of contractility; turgid, and will not bleed on cutting. \\nFig. 1.10:  Severe crush injury leg. \\nGunshot injuries: These injuries may be superficial or deep. Usually entry wound and exit wound will be present. It causes explosive and destructive injuries along with burn injuries in the deeper planes and organs. It can be high velocity injuries with massive bleeding and major organ injuries.\"), 0.17492008504393763)]\n"
