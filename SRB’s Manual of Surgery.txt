 –Avulsion. 
 –Devitalised injury.
 –Vascular injury.
 –Multiple irregular wounds.
 –Burns. 
 Fracture of the underlying bone may be present. 
 Wound dehiscence, infection, delayed healing are common.
 
 Liberal excision of devitalised tissue and allowing to heal 
by secondary intention is the management.
 Secondary suturing, skin graft or flap may be neede d.

II. Classification based on the type of the wound 
Cle
an incised wound: It is a tidy, simple, clean cut  wound with 
linear cut edges; usually due to a sharp object like blade, glass 
piece or knife. It is treated by primary suturing. 
Fig. 1.2:  Clean incised wound. 
Lacerated wound: It has ragged edges with some part of the 
tissues getting devitalized; viability of the tissues may be impaired; depth of the injury and tissue damage should be carefully assessed. Proper adequate wound excision, thorough warm saline wash and suturing of the wound layer-by-layer is required. 
Figs 1.3A and B: Lacerated wounds. 
Bruise or contusion: It is due to blow or blunt force to the 
skin and tissues underneath wherein blood vessels or capil-laries are damaged underneath. There is skin discolouration without breaking of the skin; broken vessels cause seepage of blood underneath; minor soft tissue injury crushes small vessels without breaking the skin accumulating trapped blood underneath. It is more on the skin over the bones; lax area like face, scrotum, eyes; vascular areas; children, old aged, fair skin people. 
Haematoma: It is a localized collection of blood after 
blunt trauma or after surgery. Collected fluid blood in few minutes to hours gets clotted; later eventually it gets lique-fied and shows discoloured fluid. It may be subcutaneous/ intramuscular/subfascial/intra-articular. Large haematoma may get infected to form an abscess; so large haematoma needs drainage under general or regional anaesthesia. Small haematoma usually gets absorbed (like scalp haematoma). Often haematoma contains reddish plasmatic fluid which should be aspirated using wide bore needle. Complications are—pressure effects and abscess formation; both needs 
incision and drainage under anaesthesia. Haematoma causing cosmetic problems may require needle aspiration. Haema-toma can occur spontaneously in coagulation disorders (haemophilia) or in individuals who are on anticoagulant drug therapy. A

Fig. 1.8: Multiple abrasions.
Fig. 1.9: Penetrating wound of the abdomen.
Penetrating wounds: They are similar like puncture wounds; 
due to stab. Abdomen and chest are common sites. Liver, bowel, spleen, major vessels and other visceral organs may be 
Fig. 1.4:  Haematoma of eyelid. 
Fig. 1.5:  Haematoma in the groin being aspirated. Haematoma may 
get infected or can compress adjacent structures.
Fig. 1.6:  Subungual haematoma. Often nail may need to be 
removed to evacuate the blood clot.
Abrasion: It is superficial injury (scratch/graze/pressure/contact) and is due to shearing of the skin where the surface is rubbed off. This tangential force causes loss of epidermis exposing dermal vessels and nerves leading into profuse painful oozing. Abrasion heals by epithelialisation. Any dirt or foreign body on the abrasion should be removed to avoid formation of poor tattoo like scar. 
Puncture wounds and bites: It is usually a stab wound with a 
pointed object; here depth of the wound is more than the width. Deeper vital structures or organs may be injured, so should be assessed; foreign body or object may be present in the depth of the wound. Wound should be explored under general or regional anaesthesia to assess the depth and severity of the injury and sutured layer by layer after through saline wash.

involved. Ultrasound and CT scan should be done to evaluate 
deeper organ injuries. Under general anaesthesia wound should be explored properly. 
Traction and avulsion injuries: 
These are complex injuries 
with tissues getting displaced from its normal anatomical 
position and alignment. It can 
occur in single plane like in 
subcutaneous tissue or in multiple planes like in machinery injuries, major injuries or degloving injuries. Ischaemia, bleeding, sepsis, loss of wide tissue area are common prob-lems. Open traction injury occurs on the surface. Closed traction injury can occur in deeper plane like brachial plexus injury or traction bowel injury. After initial resuscitation, definitive treatment like skin graft or nerve repair should be done. 
Crush injury: It is due to major wounds, war wounds, 
natural disaster like earth quake injuries, tourniquet injury. It leads into—compartment syndrome; muscle ischaemia; loss 
of tissues; gangrene; sepsis. Muscle will lose its viability which is identified by its colour (dark coloured with loss 
of shining); loss of contractility; turgid, and will not bleed on cutting. 
Fig. 1.10:  Severe crush injury leg. 
Gunshot injuries: These injuries may be superficial or deep. Usually entry wound and exit wound will be present. It causes explosive and destructive injuries along with burn injuries in the deeper planes and organs. It can be high velocity injuries with massive bleeding and major organ injuries. 
Injuries to bones and joints: It is common in all major injuries; 
should be identified clinically and confirmed radiologically. It needs specialized management like reduction, plating etc. 
Injuries to nerves, arteries, veins (major vessels), deeper 
organs: It needs initial resuscitation, later staged management as per individual patient basis depending on the severity and extent of injury and loss of function. 
Closed blunt injury: It may be due to fall, blunt injury wherein 
no obvious external injury may be seen but deeper injury occurs; it may be often severe enough to cause major injury like in blunt abdominal injury causing bowel/liver/spleen/renal injuries. 
Note: 
Wound may be closed (bruise, haematoma, blunt injury); open (abrasion, 
incised, lac
erated, penetrating) or complex (traction/avulsion, crush or 
gunshot injuries). III. C lassification based on thickness of the wound
 xSuperficial wound involving 
only epidermis and dermal papillae. 
 xPartial thickness wound 
with skin loss up to deep dermis with 
only deepest part of the dermis, hair follicle shafts and sweat 
glands are left behind. 
 xFull thickness 
wound with loss of entire skin and subcutaneous 
tissue causing spacing out of the skin edges. 
 xDeep wounds are the one extending deeper, across deep fascia into
 
muscles or deeper structures. 
 xComplicat
ed wounds are one associated with injury to vessels 
or nerves. 
 xPene
trating wound is one which penetrates into either natural 
cavities or organs. 
IV . Classification based on involvement of structures
 xSimple wounds are one involving only one or
gan or tissue. 
 xCombined/complex wounds are one involving mixed tissues. 
Fig. 1.11:  Complex wound exposed tendons.
V . Classification based on the time elapsed
Acute wounds are generally defined as those that progress through 
the normal phases of healing and typically show signs of healing in less than 4 weeks; examples are—surgical or traumatic or burn wounds; progress through the healing phases in a timely and orderly fashion - haemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling or maturation.Chronic wounds are defined as those that do not follow the normal healing process and show no signs of healing in 4 weeks. It fails to progress through the normal phases of healing but with prolonged inflammatory phase. Diabetes, venous/arterial diseases, nutritional deficiencies are the causes. Hypoxia initially is a potent stimulus for fibroblast activity and angiogenesis; persisting hypoxia impedes fibroblast and collagen activity and also allows bacterial invasion to make wounds chronic. Chronic wounds are chronically infected with biofilms which interfere mainly with the inflammatory phase of healing, contributing to the non-healing. A biofilm is a complex structure of microorganisms contained in an extracellular matrix of proteins and polysaccharides that adhere to a surface, creating a protected environment for the organisms. Chronic ulcers are unrespon-sive to dressing treatment; it requires biopsy, culture study, definitive treatment like wound debridement, V AC (Vacuum Assisted Closure) therapy, skin grafting or flap. Specific conditions like tuberculosis if present should be treated. Malignancy if confirmed is treated by wide local excision and skin graft.

Wound healing is complex method to achieve anatomical and 
functional integrity of disrupted tissue by various components like neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, fibroblasts, collagen; in an organised staged pathways—haemostasis → inflammation → proliferation → matrix synthesis (collagen and proteoglycan ground substance) → maturation → remodelling → epithelialisation → wound contraction (by myofibroblasts). 
Types of Wound Healing
Primary	Healing	(First	Intention)
 xIt occurs in a clean incised wound or surgical wound. 
Wound edges are approximated with sutures. There is more epithelial regeneration than fibrosis. Wound heals rapidly with complete closure. Scar will be linear, smooth, and supple. 
Secondary 	Healing	(Second	Intention)
 xIt occurs in a wound with extensive soft tissue loss like in major trauma, burns and wound with sepsis. It heals slowly with fibrosis. It leads into a wide scar, often hypertrophied and contracted. It may lead into disability. 
 xRe-epithelialisation occurs from remaining dermal elements or wound margins.
Fig. 1.18: Wound in the abdomen healing with second intention 
which requires secondary suturing once it granulates well. Secondary suturing is done after 10–14 days, once wound granulates well with proper control of infection. Scar in such type is prone to form incisional hernia.
Healing	by	Third	Intention 	(Ter tiary	Wound	Healing	or	
Delayed	Primar
y	Closure)	
After wound debridement and control of local infection, wound is closed with sutures or covered using skin graft. Primary contaminated or mixed tissue wounds heal by tertiary intention.

cavity due to bowel perforation is a dirty wound .

Stages of wound healing 
 Stage of inflammation.
 Stage of granulation tissue formation and organi  sa tion. Here due 
to fibroblastic activity synthesi  sa
tion of collagen and ground 
substance occurs. 
 Stage of epithelialisation. 
 Stage of scar formation and resorption.
 Stage of maturation. 
Phases of Wound Healing 
Inflammatory 	phase	(Lag	or	Substrat e	or	Exudative 	Phase)	
 xIt begins immediately after formation and lasts for 72 hours. 
 xThere
 is initial arteriolar vasoconstriction, thrombus formation, 
platelet aggregation due to endothelial damage and release of 
adenosine diphosphate (ADP). 
 xLater vasodilatation and increased vascular permeability develops. 
 xHere haemostasis, coagulation and chemotaxis  occur
. 
Note: 
Coagulation begins at wound haematoma →  formation of platelet 
fibrin thrombus → release of cytokines, PDGF (platelet-derived growth 
factor), epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor β (TGF – β), platelet activating factor and platelet factor IV, fibrin, sero -
tonin. Chemotaxis causes first neutrophil migration, and then activa-tion of macrophages, lymphocytes leading into phagocytosis, wound debridement, matrix activation, angiogenesis. Chemotaxis factors are complement factors, interleukin-1, TNF-α (tumour necrosis factor-α) TGF–β and platelet factor. Activated macrophages produce free radi-cals and nitric oxide; release cytokine to activate lymphocytes which release interferon and interleukin (called as lymphokines). These factors attract polymorpho nuclear leucocytes (PMN—poly morphonuclear cells–neutrophills) in 48 hours secreting inflammatory mediators and bactericidal oxygen derived-free radicals. Injured tissues and platelet release histamine, serotonin and prostaglandins which increases the vascular permeability by vasodilatation. These actions are reduced in diabetes mellitus, Cushing’s syndrome and immunosuppression increasing the sepsis rate. 
 xAll these cause features of acute inflammation — rubor, calor, 
tumour, dolor and loss of function. 
Proliferative 	Phase	( Collagen/ Fibroblastic 	phase)	
 xIt begins from 3rd day and lasts for 3–6 weeks. There will be forma-
tion of granulation tissue and repair of the wound. Granulation 
tissue contains fibroblasts, neocapillaries, collagen, fibronectin and hyaluronic acid. 
 x(1) Initial angiogenesis
 (growth of new blood vessels) occurs 
by release of vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF) by keratinocytes; by release of TNF-α, TGF–β, PDGF, FGF by macrophages. (2) Eventual fibroplasia develops by fibroblast activity with formation of the collagen and ground substance/glycosaminoglycans. Type III collagen is deposited initially in a random fashion. (3) Later re-epithelialisation of the wound surface occurs by migration of basal layer of the retained epidermis which proliferates, differentiates and stratifies to form wound closure. Remodelling 	phase	(Matur ation	P hase)	
 xIt begins at 6 weeks and lasts for 6 months to 1 or 2 years. 
 xThe
re is maturation of collagen by cross linking and realignment 
of collagen fibers along the line of tension, which is responsible for tensile strength of the scar. There is reduced wound vascularity. Fibroblast and myofibroblast activity causes wound contraction. Type III collagen is replaced by type I collagen causing maturation of the collagen. Ratio of type I collagen to type III collagen becomes 4:1. 
 xEarly extracellular matrix 
contains fibronectin and collagen type 
III; eventually it contains glycosaminoglycans and proteoglycans; final matrix contains type I collagen. 
 xScar strength 
is 3% in 1 week; 20% in 3 weeks; 80% in 12 weeks. 
Final matured scar is acellular and avascular. 
Note:  
Initially fibrin, fibronectin, proteoglycans deposition occurs; later 
collagen protein develops to form scar. Normal dermal skin contains 80% type I (20% type III) collagen; granulation tissue contains mainly type III collagen; scar contains both type I and III collagen, initially in equal proportion, later becomes 4:1. Basic essential components of collagen are proline and lysine. Hydroxylation of lysine and later glycosylation of this hydroxylysine decides the type of collagen molecule. Hydroxylation of both proline and lysine as essential step needs adequate concentration of vitamin C, iron and α ketogluteric acid. Collagen deposition in the wound is assessed by quantity of hydroxyproline excreted in urine. There is a balanced activity of collagen production and degradation of collagen (collagenolysis). Collagen is broken down by collagenase and MMPs (matrix metallo- proteinases). Procollagen through procollagenase →  collagen fibril → 
cross linking →  collagen fiber →  deposition. Deposited collagen → 
through collagenase →  degradation and collagenolysis. 
Clinical diagnosis is an art, and the mastery of an art has no end: you can always be a better diagnostician
—Logan ClendeningPoints to be remembered 
 PMN cells survive only for 24 hours; so after 48 hours PMNs won’t 
be found in the wound significantly; PMNs are not needed for wound healing. 
 Activated monocytes called macrophages predominate after 48 hours which will persist until completion of the wound healing. Macrophages are the main cells of wound healing. Macrophages secrete TNF - α , interleukin -1, fibroblast growth factor (FGF), 
proteinases (MMPs – matrix metallo proteinases). 
 B lymphocyte will not have any role in wound healing; T lymphocytes produce stimulatory cytokines like interleukin – 1 supporting the fibroblast activity. 
 Collagen and glycosamines are produced by fibroblasts. Tropoco -
llagen is produced which aggregates to form collagen fibrils. 
 Hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine are synthesized by specific enzymes using iron, α ketoglutarate and vitamin C. 
 Fibroblast requires vitamin C to produce collagen. 
 Granulation tissue and early scar contains type III collagen. 
 Final scar contains type I collagen mainly. 
 Final extra cellular matrix contains type I collagen and proteo -
glycans. 
 Collagen production decreases after 4 weeks of wound healing (declines in 28-42 days). 
 Eighty per cent of tensile strength of normal skin will be achieved finally but not 100%

Wound infection:  Infection prolongs inflammatory phase, releases 
toxins and utilizes vital nutrients thereby prevents wound epithelialisa-
tion. The β-haemolytic streptococci more than 105 per gram of tissue 
prevent wounds healing. Formation of biofilms on the wound surface by microorganisms prevents wound healing. 
Anaemia: Haemoglobin less than 8g % causes poor oxygenation of 
tissues preventing healing of the wounds. 
Hypoxia: Hypoxia prevents fibroblast proliferation and collagen 
synthesis; it also promotes bacterial invasion into the wound. Causes of hypoxia are—arterial diseases, cardiac failure, respiratory causes, hypotension, smoking, tobacco, infection, diabetes mellitus and radiation. 
Radiotherapy: Both external radiotherapy or ionizing radiation cause 
endarteritis, fibrosis and delay in wound healing. Radiation may itself cause local tissue necrosis, sepsis and hypoxia. 
Systemic and metabolic causes: Diabetes mellitus affects all stages 
of wound healing. Cardiac, renal, hepatic, respiratory diseases prevent wound healing. Tissue oedema impairs wound healing. HIV and immunosuppression of varying causes, malignancy leads into poor wound healing. Jaundice interferes with wound healing. Obesity causes hypoperfusion, reduced microcirculation, increased wound tension and hence prevents wound healing. 
Drugs:  Steroids interfere with activation of macrophages, fibro-
blasts and angiogenesis in the early phase of healing (proliferative). 
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) decrease collagen production. Chemotherapeutic agents used in oncology inhibit cellular proliferation, protein synthesis. Alcohol consumption decreases the phagocyte response and pro-inflammatory cytokine release; diminishes 
host response and thus increasing the infection rate.

 Neuropathies of different causesFactors	affecting	Wound	Healing
Age: In younger age group wound healing is faster and better. In 
elderly healing is delayed due to reduction in collagen synthesis, epithelialisation, growth factors and angiogenesis. But final scar will be excellent in old individuals. 
Nutrition: Adequate vitamin, trace elements, fatty acids and proteins 
are essential for wound healing. Vitamin A deficiency affects mono-
cyte activation, inflammatory phase, collagen synthesis and growth factor actions. Vitamin K deficiency affects synthesis of prothrombin (II), factors VII, IX and X. Vitamin E, being an antioxidant stabilizes the cell membrane. Vitamin C deficiency impairs collagen synthesis, 
fibroblast proliferation and angiogenesis; increases the capillary fragility and susceptibility for infection. Zinc is an essential cofactor for RNA and DNA polymerase; magnesium is a co-factor for synthesis 
of proteins and collagen; copper is a required co-factor for cytochrome oxidase, for cytosolic anti-oxidant superoxide dismutase, and for the optimal cross-linking of collagen; Iron is required for the hydroxyla-
tion of proline and lysine. Glutamine is the most abundant amino acid in plasma; is a major source of energy for rapidly proliferating cells such as fibroblasts, lymphocytes, epithelial cells, and macrophages. The serum concentration of glutamine is reduced after major surgery, trauma, and sepsis, and supplementation of this amino acid improves nitrogen balance and diminishes immunosuppression. Glutamine stimulates the inflammatory immune response in early wound healing. Oral glutamine supplementation improves wound breaking strength and of mature collagen. Arginine  is a semi-essential amino acid that 
is required in growth, severe stress, and injury. Arginine modulates immune function, wound healing, hormone secretion, vascular tone, and endothelial function. Arginine is a precursor to proline; supports collagen deposition, angiogenesis, and wound contraction. Under psychological stress situations, the metabolic demand of arginine increases, and its supplementation hastens the wound healing. Serum 
albumin level less than 2 g/dl causes prolonged inflammatory phase, decreased fibroplasia, neovascularisation and cell synthesis and wound remodeling and hence decreased wound healing. Wounds in patients who remain in catabolic state will not heal. Collagen is the 
major protein component of connective tissue; it contains mainly glycine, proline, and hydroxyproline. Collagen synthesis requires hydroxylation of lysine and proline, and co-factors such as ferrous iron and vitamin C. Polyunsaturated fatty acids which cannot be synthesized de novo by mammals, consist mainly of omega-6 (found 
in soybean oil) and omega-3 (found in fish oil—fatty acids such as eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] and docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]). They affect pro-inflammatory cytokine production, cell metabolism, gene expression and angiogenesis; improve the systemic immune function of the host, thus reducing infectious complications.

Management of Wounds 
Wound	cleaning	
Wound cleaning is needed to optimize the healing environ -
ment. It is achieved by removing visible devitalized tissues or 
dressing materials or excess exudates or crusts. 
Absolute aseptic technique should be used while cleaning 
the wound; warm sterile isotonic normal saline (37°C—this is optimum temperature to support cellular activity) is ideal; normal exudates in the wound should be removed; gentle cleaning of the wound is important to minimize the interfer -
ence of the wound-healing process. Cleaning agent should be of neutral pH and nontoxic; delipidising agents, antiseptics, alkaline soaps should be avoided. Gentle irrigation of warm saline using a sterile syringe on the wound surface is ideal; rubbing with undue force using cotton or gauze may cause mechanical damage on the process of wound healing. 
Wound is measured either in two dimensions (length and 
width) or in three dimensions (length, width and depth). 
Specific	Management
 xWound is inspected and classified as per the type of wounds.
 xIf it is in the vital area, then:
 The airway should be maintained.
 The bleeding, if present, should be controlled. 
 Intravenous fluids are started. 
 Oxygen, if required, may be given. 
 Deeper communicating injuries and fractures, etc. 
should be looked for.
 xIf it is an incised wound then primary suturing is done after 
thorough cleaning. 
 xIf it is a lacerated wound then the wound is excised and 
primary suturing is done.
 xIf it is a crushed or devitalised wound there will be oedema and tension in the wound. So after wound debridement or wound excision by excising all devitalised tissue, the oedema is allowed to subside for 2–6 days. Then delayed 
primary suturing is done. 
 xIf it is a deep devitalised wound, after wound debridement 
it is allowed to granulate completely. Later, if the wound is small secondary suturing is done. If the wound is large a 
split skin graft (Thiersch graft) is used to cover the defect.
 xIn a wound with tension, fasciotomy is done so as to prevent the development of compartment syndrome. 
 xVascular or nerve injuries are dealt with accordingly. Vessels are sutured with 6-zero polypropylene nonabsorb-able suture material. If the nerves are having clean cut wounds it can be sutured primarily with polypropylene 6-zero or 7-zero suture material. If there is difficulty inidentifying the nerve ends or if there are crushed cut ends of nerves then marker stitches are placed using silk at the site and later secondary repair of the nerve is done. 
 xInternal injuries (intracranial by craniotomy, intrathoracic by 
intercostal tube drainage, intra-abdominal by laparotomy) has to be dealt with accordingly. Fractured bone is also identified and properly dealt with. 
 xAntibiotics, fluid and electrolyte balance, blood transfusion, tetanus toxoid (0.5 ml intramuscular to deltoid muscle), or antitetanus globulin (ATG) injection.
Later definitive management is done with:
Wound debridement (wound toilet, or wound excision) is liberal 
excision of all devitalised tissue at regular intervals (of 48-72 hours) until healthy, bleeding, vascular tidy wound is created.
Types of wound suturing 
	Primary	suturing means suturing the wound immedia  tely within 
6 hours
. It is done in clean incised wounds. 
	Delayed	primary	suturing	means suturing the wound in 48 hours 
t
o 10 days. It is done in lacerated wounds. This time is allowed 
for the oedema to subside.
	Secondary 	suturing means suturing the w ound in 10–14 days or 
later. It is done in infected wounds. After the control of infection, 
once healthy granulation tissue appears, secondary suturing is done.
Figs 1.20A and B: Delayed primary suturing is done once oedema 
over the wound subsides. It is done as single layer interrupted deep sutures using monofilament polypropylene or polyethylene.

Features are—It compromises circulation and function mainly 
of muscles and nerves. It often maintains the normal colour and temperature of the fingers and distal pulses may not be oblit -
erated in spite of severe muscle ischaemia. Muscle ischaemia more than 4 hours causes muscle death and myoglobinuria. Irreversible nerve damage develops if ischaemia persists for 8 hours. Progressive, persistent severe pain which is aggravated by passive muscle stretching is the diagnostic sign. Tense tender regional lymph node is typical. Pulse will be usually normally felt in compartment syndrome; but may become absent if there is associated arterial injury. Compartment pressure more than 30 mmHg is an indication for fasciotomy.
Fig. 1.22:  Necrotizing fasciitis with extensive skin involvement which 
requires adequate wound excision and eventual skin coverage.
Fig. 1.23:  Fasciotomy for compartment syndrome should be 
longitudinal, deep and lengthy and should decompress the 
compartment to expose the underlying muscle. It should be done early.
It is common in calf and forearm. Closed injuries cause 
haematoma leading to increased pressure. It is often associated with fracture of the underlying bone which in turn compresses the major vessel further aggravating the ischaemia causing pallor, pulseless
 ness, p
ain, paraesthesia, diffuse swelling 
and cold limb . 
If allowed to progress it may eventually lead to gangrene 
or chronic ischaemic contracture with deformed, disabled 
limb. 
Problems with the compartment syndrome
 Infection, septicaemia and abscess formation 
 Renal failure 
 Gangrene of the limb 
 Chronic ischaemic contracture 
 Disabled limb, Volkmann's ischaemic contracture 
Muscle necrosis releases myoglobulin which is excreted 
in the urine, damages the kidneys leading into renal failure.
Note: 
Affected muscle when passively stretched worsens the pain—the most 
reliable clinical sign.

Figs 1.21A and B: Secondary suturing is done once wound is 
healthy after control of wound infection.
Principles of wound suturing 
 Primary suturing should not be done if there is oedema/infec -
tion/devitalised tissues/haematoma 
 Always associated injuries to deeper structures like vessels/nerves or tendons should be looked for before closure of the wound
 Wound should be widened by extending the incision whenever needed to have proper evaluation of the deeper structures—proper
	exploration
 Proper cleaning, asepsis, wound excision/debridement
 Any foreign body in the wound should be removed 
 Skin closure if it is possible without tension
 Skin cover by graft/flap—immediate or delayed 
 Untidy wound should be made tidy and clean before suturing 
 Proper aseptic precautions should be undertaken 
 Antibiotics/analgesics are needed 
 Sutured wound should be inspected in 48 hours 
 Sutures are removed after 7 days 
Remember 
	Wound	toilet is washing the wound thoroughly using normal
saline—ideal
	Wound	debridement (french-letting loose) is allo wing content
to come out by release incisions or facio  tomies. But c
ommonly 
debridement is used for wound excision
	Wound	excision is actually correct terminology for excision of
devitalised tissues once or ser
ially
	Radical	wound	excision is (pseudotumour appr oach) is excising
entire devitalised tissues leaving tissues with visible bleeding from all layers
CoMPARTME nT SY ndRoME
Compartment syndrome is a special entity; common in leg, 
forearm, thigh and arm; is a syndrome due to increased intra -
compartmental pressure within a limited space area.
Causes are— Narrowed space due 
to tight dressings/plaster 
cast, lying on one limb in comatous patient; increased content 
within the compartment due to trauma like fractures, oedema, ischaemic injury, haematoma, positioning after trauma, burn injury, etc.; high pressure injection injuries like gun injury, oil based material injury, extravasation of chemotherapeutic drugs; snake bite. B

Treatment
 xCompartment pressure will be persistently more than 30 mm 
Hg. It can be measured by placing a fine catheter in the compart-ment and using a pressure monitor. This is an indication for fasciotomy. Adequate lengthy incision involving skin, fat and deep fascia should be done until underneath muscle bulges out properly. Multiple incisions should be made if needed. Separate incision in each compartment should be done. 
Fasciotomy done in forearm anterior compartment is a specific method. 
Carpal tunnel should be released by cutting flexor retinaculum. Inci-
sion begins at the junction of the thenar and hypothenar area; extends proximally initially transverse across flexion crease of the wrist at the ulnar border; then across forearm towards radial side of forearm; then in proximal forearm towards medial side creating convex flap towards lateral side. In the elbow it crosses along the medial border to reach the arm where it runs in arm along the medial part of the anterior arm. Injury to major nerves, palmar cutaneous branch of median nerve should be avoided while placing the incision. Incision should be deepened by cutting the deep fascia along the entire length of the incision. Dorsal fasciotomy  
should be added by placing longitudinal lengthy incision in the midline. Two longitudinal incisions on the dorsum of the hand also should be made. 
Fig. 1.24:  Incision for fasciotomy in upper limb begins at flexor 
retinaculum extending into the forearm with a convex flap towards radial 
side eventually leading towards medial epicondyle of the elbow joint.

CRuSH  I nJuR Y 
Crush injury is one where a part of the body is being squeezed/
compressed between two high force or pressure systems. It causes exten-sive lacerations, bruising, compartment syndrome, crush syndrome, fractures, haemorrhage, etc. with extensive tissue destruction and devitalisation. Renal failure, hypovolaemic shock and sepsis are the most dreaded problems in crush injuries.

Fig. 1.25B
Figs 1.25A and B: Traumatic crush injury pelvis exposing testis and 
iliac vessels. Patient underwent hemipelvectomy.
CRuSH  SY ndRoME
It is due to crushing of muscles causing extravasation of blood 
and release of myohaemoglobin into the circulation leading to acute tubular necrosis and acute renal failure. 
Causes 
 xEarthquakes.
 xMining and industrial accidents.
 xAir crash.
 xTourniquet. Initially tension increases in the muscle compart
 me
nt 
commonly in the limb, which itself impedes the circulation and increases the ischaemic damage. In 3 days, urine becomes discoloured and scanty, patient becomes restless, apathy and delirious with onset of uraemia. Crush syndrome is often life- threatening. Injury is much worser than initial look.
Effects of crush syndrome
 Renal failure
 Toxaemia
 Septicaemia
 Disability with extensive tissue loss
 Gas gangrene
Treatment 
 xTension in the muscle compartment is relieved by placing 
multiple parallel deep incisions in the limb so as to prevent further damage— Fasciotomy. 
 xRheomacrodex, or mannitol is given to improve the urine output by improving the renal function.
 xAlkalisation of urine is done by giving sodium citrate or sodium bicarbonate. It increases the solubility of acid 
haematin in the urine and so promotes its excretion. Urinary pH should be above 6.5 until urine does not show any myoglobin. Mannitol-alkaline diuresis should be 8 litre/day. 
 xInitial aggressive volume load using saline about 1-1.5 litres/hour is ideal in these patients. 
 xHaemodialysis is done sometimes as a life-saving proce-dure.

Types of scar
 A mature scar is paler, acellular, softer, flat, with reduced blood
vessels and fibroblasts, without itching (diminishes). 
 An atrophic scar is pale, flat and stretched. 
 A hypertrophic scar is excess scar but will not extend beyondthe margin of the scar of the original wound; there is prolonged inflammatory phase of wound healing. It develops in 1 to 3 months after trauma. It improves spontaneously. 
 Keloid is persistent excessive growth of the scar beyond itsmargin into the adjacent skin; occurs in a triangular area between two shoulder points and xiphisternum. It develops 3 months to years after the trauma; progressive. Presternal area is the commonest site. 
Note: 
 A linear scar is supple, thin, soft occurs after healing by primary 
intention. 
 A wide, irregular firm scar occurs after healing by secondaryintention or when there is infection
|
KEL oId: ‘Like a claw’
 xKeloid is common in blacks. Common in females. 
 xGenetically predisposed. Often familial. Very rare in Cauca-
sians.
 xThere is defect in maturation and stabilization of collagen fibrils. Normal collagen bundles are absent.
 xKeloid continues to grow even after 6 months, may be for many years. It extends into adjacent normal skin. It is brownish black/pinkish black (due to vascularity) in colour, painful, tender and sometimes hyperaesthetic; spreads and causes itching. 
 xKeloid may be associated with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome or scleroderma. 
 xWhen keloid occurs following an unnoticed trauma without scar formation is called as spontaneous keloid , commonly 
seen in Negroes. 
 xSome keloids occasionally become non-progressive after initial growth. 
 xPathologically keloid contains proliferating immature fibroblasts, proliferating immature blood vessels and type III thick collagen stroma.
Site: Common over the sternum. Other sites are upper arm, chest wall, lower neck in front. 
Differential diagnosis: Hypertrophic scar.Treatment: Controversial. 
 xSteroid injection—intrakeloidal triamcinolone, is injected at 
regular intervals, may be once in 7–10 days, of 6–8 injections.
 xSteroid injection—excision—steroid injection. 
 xTriamcinolone reduces the fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis; it is the first line of therapy  for keloid
 xMethotrexate and vitamin A therapy into the keloid.
 xSilicone gel sheeting ; topical retinoids.
 xLaser therapy. 
 xVitamin E/palm oil massage.
 xIntralesional excision retaining the scar margin may prevent recurrence. It is ideal and better than just excision .  xOther measures: 
 Catheterization.
 Oxygen therapy. 
 Antibiotics.
 Blood transfusion.
 Correction of severe hyperkalaemia. 
Note: 
Doing fasciotomy several days after crush injury may not be safe as it 
may lead to sudden release of myoglobulin causing myoglobulinuria and renal failure. 
dEGL oVInG InJuRIES 
 xIt occurs due to shearing force between tissue planes as traction—
avulsion injury. It usually occurs between subcutaneous tissue and deep 
fascia or between muscle and bone. It can be localised 
or circumferential. 
 xAvulsion 
injury strips off the superficial tissues exposing the 
neurovascular bundle, muscles, tendons, and bone. Degloving injury can be open or closed.
Fig. 1.26:  Degloving injury wherein skin often with soft tissues gets 
avulsed off the deeper plane to create extensive raw area which may 
bleed/get infected.
 xIt can be in one plane or multiple planes. 
 xIt is commonly 
observed in machinery injuries or major road traffic 
accidents. It is much more extensive than of on initial presentation. 
 xUnde
r anaesthesia fluoroscein is injected intravenously and viable 
skin is visible as fluorescent yellowish—green colour under ultra-
violet light. As injection of fluoroscein is not fully safer, serial excision is better to look for dermal punctate bleeding. 
 xIt needs examination 
under general anaesthesia, wound excision/
radical excision, flap coverage, microflap surgeries, skin grafting, with proper asepsis, and blood transfusion as there is significant blood loss in these injuries.
SCAR 
Initially immature scar is formed during remodeling phase; this scar 
is disorganized contains type III collagen. Such scar is itchy, raised, 
hard and pink in colour. Over the pan of 12 months scar gets matured fully by making disorganised collagen getting aligned along the stress lines and formation of more type I collagen. This matured scar is soft, supple, pale and flat without any itch. Hypertrophic scar and keloid persists to have more type III collagen than type I collagen unlike in matured scar.

 xExcision and irradiation or irradiation alone. 
 xExcision and skin grafting may be done. 
Note: 
Excision and primary suturing has got high recurrence rate; hence it is 
not usually practiced.
Recurrence rate is very high —more than 50%.

 xOccurs anywhere in the body.
 xNot genetically predisposed. Not familial.
 xGrowth usually limits up to 6 months.
 xIt is limited to the scar tissue only. It will not extend to

Complications
 xOften this scar breaks repeatedly and causes infection, pain. 
 xAfter repeated breakdown it may turn into Marjolin’s 
ulcer.
Treatment
 xIt is controlled by pressure garments or often revision exci-
sion of scar and closure, if required with skin graft.

PRoBLEMS WITH  Wound  HEALI nG 
 xWound infection  is common in devitalized deep difficult wounds. 
Diabetes, immunosuppression, cytotoxic drugs, anaemia, malnutri-
tion, malignancy increases the chances of wound infection. 
 xWound dehiscence  is common in all 
above said adverse factors. 
Wound suddenly gives away with pain causing copious serosan-guineous discharge. After laparotomy when done specially as an emergency in trauma, acute abdomen and also in malignancy, abdominal closed wound may burst in 5–7 days. Usually all layers of abdomen give away causing discharge, occasionally bowel will 
extrude out. It needs emergency closure of the abdominal wound using specialized sutures or retention sutures. 
 xHypertrophic scar 
or keloid formation due to altered collagen 
synthesis in the wound healing process. Collagen synthesis is 
increased 3–6 times in hypertrophic scar and 20 times in keloid.

Definition
An ulcer is a break in the continuity of the covering epithelium, 
either skin or mucous membrane due to molecular death. 
Parts of an Ulcer
a. Margin : It may be regular or irregular. It may be rounded or oval.
b. Edge:  Edge is the one which connects floor of the ulcer to the
margin. Different edges are:
Sloping edge. It is seen in a healing ulcer. 
 Its inner part is red because of red, healthy granulation tissue. 
 Its outer part is white due to scar/fibrous tissue. 
 Its middle part is blue due to epithelial prolife  ration. 
Undermined edge  is seen in a tuberculous ulcer. Disease process 
advances in deeper plane (in subcutaneous tissue) whereas (skin) 
epidermis proliferates inwards. 
Punched out edge  is seen in a gummatous (syphilitic) ulcer and 
trophic ulcer. It is due to endarteritis. 
Raised and beaded edge (pearly white) is seen in a rodent ulcer 
(BCC). Beads are due to proliferating active cells. 
Everted edge (rolled out edge ): It is seen in a carcino  matous ulcer 
due to spill of the proliferating malignant tissues over the normal skin.
c. 
 Floor:  It is the one which is seen. Floor may contain discharge,
granulation tissue or slough.
d.  Base:  Base is the one on which ulcer rests. It may be bone or soft
tissue.
Fig. 1.34:  Parts of an ulcer.
Fig. 1.35:  Ulcer edges.
Induration of an Ulcer 
Induration is a clinical palpatory sign which means a specific type of hardness in the diseased tissue. It is obvious in well-differentiated carcinomas. It is better felt in squamous cell carcinoma. It is also observed in long standing ulcer with underlying fibrosis. It is absent or less in poorly differentiated carcinomas and malignant melanoma. Less indurated carcinoma is more aggressive. Specific types of indurations are observed in venous diseases and chronic deep venous thrombosis. Brawny induration is a feature of an abscess. Induration is felt at edge, base and surrounding area of an ulcer. Induration at surrounding area signifies the extent of disease (tumour). Outermost part of the indurated area is taken as the point from where clearance of wide excision is planned.
Classifications 
Classification I ( Clinical) 
1. Spreading ulcer : Here edge is inflamed, irregular and
oedematous. It is an acute  painful ulcer; floor does not 
contain healthy granulation tissue (or granulation tissue 
is absent) but with profuse purulent discharge and slough; surrounding area is red and edematous. Regional (draining) B. Ulcer

lymph nodes are enlarged and tender due to inflammation. 
There will be associated fever, pain, impairment of func -
tions with local tissue destruction and with little evidence of regeneration.
Fig. 1.36:  Spreading ulcer copious purulent discharge with slough. 
2. Healing ulcer : Edge is sloping with healthy pink/red 
healthy granulation tissue with scanty /minimal serous 
discharge  in the floor; slough is absent; regional lymph 
nodes may or may not be enlarged but when enlarged always non-tender. Surrounding area does not show any signs of inflammation or induration; base is not indurated. Three zones  are observed in healing ulcer. Innermost red 
zone of healthy granulation tissue; middle bluish zone of 
growing epithelium; outer whitish zone  of fibrosis and scar 
formation. 
Fig. 1.37:  Healing ulcer with healthy granulation tissue in the floor.  
3. N on-healing ulcer : It may be a chronic ulcer depending on 
the cause of the ulcer; here edge will be depending on the 
cause—punched out (trophic), undermined (tuberculous), rolled out (carcinomatous ulcer), beaded (rodent ulcer); floor contains unhealthy granulation tissue and slough, and serosanguineous/purulent/bloody discharge; regional draining lymph nodes may be enlarged but non-tender.  
Fig. 1.38:  Non-healing ulcer with pale unhealthy  
granulation tissue with slough. 
4. Callous (stationary) ulcer : It is also a chronic non-healing 
ulcer; floor contains pale unhealthy, flabby, whitish yellow 
granulation tissue and thin scanty serous discharge or often with copious serosanguinous discharge, with indurated non- tender edge; base is indurated, nontender and often fixed. Ulcer does not show any tendency to heal.  It lasts for many 
months to years. Tissue destruction is more with absence of or only minimal regeneration. Induration and pigmenta -
tion may be seen in the surrounding area. There is no/less discharge. Regional lymph nodes may be enlarged; are firm/hard and nontender. It is callousness towards healing; word callous means—insensitive and cruel; and also it means— hard skinned.
Fig. 1.39: Callous ulcer without any sign of healing and, without 
any granulation tissue.  
Classification II (Based on Duration) 
1. Acute ulcer—duration is less than 2 weeks. 
2. Chronic ulcer—duration is more than 2 weeks (long).
Classification III (Pathological)
1. Specific ulcers: 
 Tuberculous ulcer.
 Syphilitic ulcer: It is punched out, deep, with “wash-leather” 
slough in the floor and with indurated base. 
 Actinomycosis. 
 Meleney’s ulcer.
